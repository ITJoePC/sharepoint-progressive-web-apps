## Background

I have always been intrigued by SharePoint as a platform, and especially in using SharePoint in a way it was not really intended for.
The approach I'm taken in this repository for developing SPA apps hosted in SharePoint has been used extensively in the past using a concept we called
[SharePoint DesignFactory ContentFiles](https://weblogs.asp.net/soever/sharepoint-designfactory-contentfiles). We used this approach in numerous projects for deploying
content (including aspx pages) into SharePoint. This was back in 2012, and in the mean time similar tools like [spsave](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spsave) 
have emerged. Also the development cycle for developing as if we are in the context of SharePoint without uploading files into SharePoint have been dramatically 
improved through tools like [sp-rest-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sp-rest-proxy).

In the blog series and the examples in this repository I hope to provide a way of working that will lead to developing powerful progressive web apps to 
unlock the information within your organization without difficult hoops to jump through with administrators within your organization to get your code up and running:-)
